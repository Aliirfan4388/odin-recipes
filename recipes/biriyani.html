        <li>Basmati Rice</li>
        <li>Chicken, Lamb, or Vegetables (for non-vegetarian or vegetarian biryani)</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Ginger-Garlic Paste</li>
        <li>Yogurt</li>
        <li>Biryani Masala (a blend of spices)</li>

        <li>Fresh Herbs (e.g., mint, cilantro)</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Biryani Recipe:</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly in cold water and soak it for 30 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet or pot, heat ghee or cooking oil over medium heat. Add sliced onions and saut√© until they turn golden brown. Remove some for garnish and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add ginger-garlic paste and chopped tomatoes to the skillet. Cook until the tomatoes are soft.</li>
        <li>Add your choice of protein (chicken, lamb, or vegetables) to the skillet and cook until it's partially cooked.</li>
        <li>Stir in biryani masala and yogurt. Cook until the spices are fragrant and the mixture thickens.</li>
        <li>Layer the partially cooked rice over the meat or vegetable mixture. Add water and salt.</li>
        <li>Cover the pot and simmer on low heat until the rice is tender and has absorbed all the flavors. You can also use a "dum" cooking method, which involves sealing the pot with dough or foil and cooking on low heat for a longer time for enhanced flavor.</li>
        <li>Garnish the biryani with the reserved fried onions and fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>Serve the biryani hot with raita (yogurt sauce) or a side salad.</li>
    </ol>
